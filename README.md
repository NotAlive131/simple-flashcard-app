    EditCardDialog.kt - A dialog that allows users to edit individual cards.

    FlashDeckCard.kt - Displays each flashcard set in a grid view. Allows users to navigate to the practice screen or edit the set.

    ViewModels - The CardViewModel is responsible for fetching data, handling user interactions, and managing the state.

    Composables - The UI is built using various reusable composables, including custom cards and dialogs.
